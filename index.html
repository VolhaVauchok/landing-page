       			 	<h2>Drive Thru Tree in Leggett</h2>
        			<p>Drive-Thru Tree Park is a privately-owned grove that has been operated by the Underwood Family since 1922. Located approximately 180 miles north of the San Francisco Bay Area, the park was an ideal stopping place for overnight or week-long stays. In 1937 the Chandelier Drive-Thru Tree was added to provide a unique treat for travelers. Visitors have been taking pictures of their vehicles inside the opening ever since. With the exception of motor homes or vehicles pulling trailers most vehicles will be able to drive through the Tree. Parking is provided for larger vehicles and tour buses.</p>

        			<h2>Shrine Drive Thru Tree in Myers Flat</h2>
        			<p>Shrine Drive Thru Tree, also known as Doust Tree, Redwood Shrine Tree and Shrine of the Redwoods, is located at 13078 California State Route 254 (Avenue of the Giants) in Myers Flat, California 3.9 mi (6.3 km) south of the Humboldt Redwoods State Park visitor center. Shrine is a chimney tree whose trunk was hollowed by fire (perhaps the result of a lightning strike) more than a century ago. Loggers reportedly spared the tree because they suspected it had little, if any, merchantable timber. Shrine became a popular tourist attraction after its owner widened the natural, angled opening through the trunk to create a 7.0 ft (2.1 m) wide and 7.0 ft (2.1 m) tall tunnel large enough to 
					accommodate vehicles. .

        			<h2>Tour Thru Tree in Klamath</h2>
        			<p> Tour Thru Tree is located at 430 California State Route 169 (Klamath Glen Road) in Klamath, California 21 mi (34 km) south of Crescent City. Tour Thru and neighboring trees were spared when the area was logged in 1967. Tour Thru, which appears in a television , is the newest and second most-popular of the three drive-through coast redwoods: as many as 60,000 vehicles visit the tree each year. Although Chandelier is more-popular, Tour Thru accommodates larger vehicles. Tour Thru Park also offers picnic tables, a unique redwood restroom, a gift shop, and (in a field across the street) a mob of emus.</p>
